You are given an array of size N in which every number is between 1 and N. Determine if there are any duplicates in it. You are allowed to destroy the array if you like./This is one of many ways to complete this task. Presort your array with your favorite sorting algorithm( bubble, quick, merge). Once sorted compare adjacent elements for quality. If two any two adjacent elements are equal then there are duplicates in the array.!
